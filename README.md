# Graphics-project-TRAFFHIC-LIGHT-Day-Night-view-


Initial Project Description
The proposed project is a 2D City Traffic Scene with Day–Night Mode developed using OpenGL (GLUT). The project simulates a real-life city environment including roads, cars, buildings, trees, traffic signals, zebra crossing, clouds, sun, moon, and stars. The system demonstrates animation, timer-based traffic control, and keyboard interaction for switching between day and night modes.

Scene-1 
Objects: Sky, Sun, Buildings, Trees, Road, Grass
Animations: (i) No vehicle movement (ii) Static environment
Mouse Interaction: No mouse interaction
Keyboard Interaction: No keyboard interaction
Scene-2 
Objects: Cars, Road, Traffic Light, Zebra Crossing, Buildings, Trees, Clouds
Animations: (i)  Cars move when traffic signal is green (ii) Clouds move continuously across the sky
Mouse Interaction: No mouse interaction
Keyboard Interaction: No keyboard interaction
Scene-3 
Objects: Traffic Light, Cars, Road, Zebra Crossing
Animations: (i) Traffic signal changes automatically using timer (Red → Yellow → Green) (ii) Car movement depends on signal state
Mouse Interaction: No mouse interaction
Keyboard Interaction: No keyboard interaction
Scene-4 
Objects: Moon, Stars, Buildings, Trees, Road, Cars, Traffic Light, Zebra Crossing
Animations: (i) Cars move based on traffic signal (ii) Stars displayed randomly in night sky
Mouse Interaction: No mouse interaction
Keyboard Interaction: Press 'N' or 'n' to toggle between Day and Night mode
 
Scene to Scene Transition: Scene transitions occur logically within the same program flow. Day and night scenes are switched dynamically using keyboard input. Traffic behavior and animations remain consistent across all scenes, resulting in a complete and realistic city traffic simulation.
